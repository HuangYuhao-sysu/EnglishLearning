        The line graph compares the four different ways that used to generate power
        in France over a period of 32 years.

        It is clear that by far the most important source of power is nuclear power.
        By contrast, The renewable power station contributed the least to power
        production.

        In 1980, Thermal power was the dominant method of power generation, accounting
        for about 110 TW-h. In contrast, nuclear and hydroelectricity power station
        generated less than 75 TW-h each, and renewable energy source only contributed
        only a negligible amount. Just one year later, the nuclear power overtook the thermal power.

        The nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of approximate 425 TW-h, whereas the
        thermal power generation saw a decrease by 1985, but remained stable after thereafter.
        The generation of hydroelectricity is about 75 TW-h in 1980 and remained 
        at this level until 2012. The figure for renewable power remained a negligible
        amount of power generation for 20 years but saw a small rise at the end.
